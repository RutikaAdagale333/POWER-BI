# POWER-BI
Netflix Data Analysis
    This project uses Power BI to explore data about Netflix.

What we did:
    Looked at Netflix shows and movies:
    How many of each kind?
    When were they released?
    Where are they from?
    What are the most popular ones?
    Maybe looked at how people use Netflix:
    If we had that kind of data.

What you'll find here:

      The main Power BI file: This is where all the charts and tables are.
      Other files: Might include data we used and notes about how we did the analysis. 
      In Dashboard click on logo using Ctrl+Click you go to page where we choose Movies or TV shows 
      After Selecting TV show or Movie we see images we click on images we get details information about that
